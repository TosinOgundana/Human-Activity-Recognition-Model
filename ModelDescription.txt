The model develops an intelligent fitness application which will automatically recognise people√ïs activities. The dataset used for this project is labelled historical activity context data of people who participated in a data collection process carried out using some smartphone built-in sensors namely: orientation, rotation, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic, sound and light sensors.
The task is one of a multi-class (also called multinomial) classification. A multi-class classification problem in machine learning is one in which we classify data points into one of three or more classes. Our data has a total of 13 classes, they are: ascending stairs, climbing down stairs, climbing upstairs, descending stairs, driving, jogging, lying, mountain ascending, mountain descending, running, sitting, standing, and walking. This means that our model should be able to correctly predict which of these activities is going on if given a set of the readings generated when someone is performing any of the 13 activities.
